5. Suggested Uses in the classroom
Suggested Uses in the Classroom
Warm-Up or Exit Ticket Activity

- Have students spend 5–10 minutes at the start or end of class practicing a set of verbs.
Use the app as a quick check to ensure students are retaining previously learned words.
Small-Group Stations

- Set up a “Verb Practice” station where students rotate in small groups.
Each group takes turns using the app while the teacher assists or observes other groups.
Homework Assignment

- Assign specific verb sets for students to practice at home.
Have students submit screenshots of their scores or short reflections on verbs they find challenging.
Pronunciation Focus

- After students submit their written answers, ask them to listen to the audio of each verb.
Reinforce accurate pronunciation by having students repeat the audio or record themselves speaking the verb forms.
Pair or Peer Teaching

- Pair stronger and weaker students so they can help each other.
One student dictates or says a verb in the present tense, and the other provides the past and past participle. They then check the app to confirm.
Vocabulary Expansion

- Encourage students to keep a vocabulary notebook, listing out any newly encountered verbs, with example sentences for each tense.
Extend the activity by incorporating synonyms or related words that can be tested in the same session.
Integrating Writing Tasks

- Once a set of verbs has been practiced, ask students to write a short paragraph or story using those past forms.
Emphasize accurate verb usage while also encouraging creativity.
Gamification and Challenges

- Organize friendly competitions. For example, see who can get the highest score after 10 tries, or who completes the largest variety of verbs in a set time limit.
Reward top performers with small, motivating incentives or recognition in class.
By combining regular practice in the app with structured classroom activities, you can help students solidify their understanding of irregular verb forms and gain confidence in using them in real-world communication.
