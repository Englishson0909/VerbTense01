**"To have another language is to possess a second soul."**

Welcome to my classroom! Hi, my name is Hansuk. Since 2004, I’ve been teaching English, and although there have been many challenges, I believe it’s crucial to keep moving forward and grow as an educator every day.

As an English teacher, I’d like to highlight some key goals for learning English:

Learning English as an EFL student can open up an entirely new world of possibilities.

- It allows learners to discover different perspectives and cultures.
- It provides access to a wealth of resources, ideas, information, and networks.
- It expands career options in the global job market.
- Finally, it boosts confidence and fosters collaboration and communication across diverse cultures.

I look forward to guiding my students toward these goals, confident that each step forward prepares them for a brighter future.

st.write("""
The three pine trees on Geogeum Island, planted over a hundred years ago, 
stand strong through changing tides, showing real perseverance.
They stay firm even under the sea, reminding us that our hopes can remain steady.

Learning a foreign language is like quietly getting through each day, 
and the calm beaches and camel-shaped shore remind us that our power to endure lies within.
