    Welcome to my classroom, Hi, my name is Hansuk. Since 2004, I’ve been teaching English, and although there have been many challenges, I believe it’s crucial to keep moving forward and grow as an educator every day.
    As an English teacher, I’d like to highlight some key goals for learning English:
    
    Learning English as an EFL student can open up an entirely new world of possibilities.
    
    It allows learners to discover different perspectives and cultures.
    
    It provides access to a wealth of resources, ideas, information, and networks.
    
    It expands career options in the global job market.
    
    Finally, it boosts confidence and fosters collaboration and communication across diverse cultures.
    I look forward to guiding my students toward these goals, confident that each step forward prepares them for a brighter future.
