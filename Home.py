As an English teacher, I’d like to highlight some key goals for learning English:
Learning English as an EFL student can open up an entirely new world of possibilities.
It allows learners to discover different perspectives and cultures.
It provides access to a wealth of resources, ideas, information, and networks.
It expands career options in the global job market.
Finally, it boosts confidence and fosters collaboration and communication across diverse cultures.
I look forward to guiding my students toward these goals, confident that each step forward prepares them for a brighter future.
To have another language is to possess a second soul
